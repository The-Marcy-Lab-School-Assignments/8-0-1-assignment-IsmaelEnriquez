# Question

What makes a middleware function different from a normal controller?

# Answer
The difference between a middleware function from a normal controller lies in their roles within the application flow. A middleware fucntion can be seen as a gatekeeper which intercepts clients requests which can perform various tasks and pass it (next())to the next middleware or applications logic. Unlike a controller, middleware does not send a response.
